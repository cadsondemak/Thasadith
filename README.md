# Thasadith
A conservative Thai text typeface inspired by an old style handwriting without the end tail flare.  Originally developed as a part of Srisakdi family. Later on Thasadith accidentally became a new spin off family from Srisakdi. Based on the concept of what if Srisakdi was born as an upright typeface during the hot metal type period. The design was focusing on how to translate the handwriting style typeface into a formal letter design by readjusting the letterforms to fit with typesetting condition. Thasadith italic (slanted) was designed in order to take the font back to the original slanted from.
